# `mondrian-rest-ui`

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/jazzido/mondrian-rest-ui.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

An experimental UI for [`mondrian-rest`](https://github.com/jazzido/mondrian-rest) inspired by [CubesViewer](https://github.com/jjmontesl/cubesviewer) and [Polestar](https://github.com/vega/polestar).

**Caveat emptor**: It's not feature complete, and it's probably not powerful enough for your needs. Contributions will be appreciated; feature requests and cries for help will be promptly redirected to `/dev/null`.
